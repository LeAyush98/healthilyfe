<p>Health monitoring web application created with Django.</p>

<h2>Features</h2> 
<p>This application helps to maintain and monitor our health and fitness. You have to enter simple body-related data and it calculates various stats. The following stats are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>BMI</li>
<li>Body Fat Percentage</li>
<li>Daily Calorie Intake</li>
<li>Ideal Weight</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Finally, using Seaborn for plotting graphs, BMI and weight are dynamically plotted on a graph and displayed on the website. Asyncio is used for faster graph output. </p>

<h2>AWS Version</h2>
<p>This web application was hosted on my EC2 instance: http://ec2-13-126-26-5.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/</p>
<p>Used AWS RDS's Postgres RDBMS and SSM's Parameter Store for securely saving important tokens.</p>

<h2>Current Development Version</h2>
<p>Latest version is a development build, that uses my local Postgres db. Important tokens are saved locally. </p>
